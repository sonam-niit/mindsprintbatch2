Generating Key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sonam.gravity@gmail.com"

starting agent in the background
eval $(ssh-agent -s)  

set up private key ass ssh-client
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
(it will ask you to enter passphrase)

(copy public key for adding it to GitHub)
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

GitHub --> settings --> SSH & GPG key --> add new SSH key and paste the copied key

Once its configured you can set origin with ssh command rather that using https and that it.
You can push code on GitHub directly using ssh.

so your origin setup look like this: git remote add origin git@github.com:sonam-niit/TestSSH.git
